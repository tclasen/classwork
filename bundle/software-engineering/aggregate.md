# Protect invariants

An aggregate is a cluster of [entities](entities.md) and [value objects](value-objects.md) treated as one consistency boundary. In [Domain-driven design](domain-driven-design.md), outside code coordinates changes through its [aggregate root](aggregate-root.md), while the aggregate protects invariants and makes transaction and concurrency choices explicit. Aggregates should be sized around consistency needs, not merely object containment.[^domain-language-reference]
