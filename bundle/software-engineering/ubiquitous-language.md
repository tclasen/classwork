# Shared vocabulary

[Domain-driven design](domain-driven-design.md) develops a deliberately shared vocabulary, called ubiquitous language, for domain experts and engineers when describing a [domain model](domain-model.md). Important terms should carry the same intended meaning in conversation, requirements, tests, and implementation. It is specific to a [bounded context](bounded-context.md), so identical words may legitimately differ across contexts.[^domain-language-reference]
