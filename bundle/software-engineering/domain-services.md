# Place cross-object behavior

In [Domain-driven design](domain-driven-design.md), a domain service expresses a meaningful domain operation that does not naturally belong to one [entity](entities.md) or [value object](value-objects.md). It should remain focused on domain meaning rather than becoming a general-purpose utility or a home for infrastructure concerns.[^domain-language-reference]
