# Model the domain

A domain model is a selective representation of the concepts, relationships, rules, and behavior that matter in a problem domain. In [domain-driven design](domain-driven-design.md), experts and engineers refine it through a [ubiquitous language](ubiquitous-language.md) and implement it inside one or more [bounded contexts](bounded-context.md). It is not a complete copy of reality or merely a database schema.[^domain-language-reference]
